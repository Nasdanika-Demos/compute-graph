The defining features of personhood and, consequently, what makes a person count as a person, differ widely among cultures and contexts. In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about personal identity and self: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes. The plural form &ldquo;people&rdquo; is often used to refer to an entire nation or ethnic group (as in &ldquo;a people&rdquo;), and this was the original meaning of the word; it subsequently acquired its use as a plural form of person.
